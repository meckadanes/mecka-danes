  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
  <p> 
	Hi my name is Mecka Danes YOUR FUTURE PROGRAMMER kung hindi papalarin taga bantay na lang ng com. shop. I'm 20 yrs old and I live in San Jose, Batangas.  A third year student at Batangas State University - Alangilan Campus with the course of Information Technology Major in Business Analytics. My favorite philosophy in life is “Failure is not the opposite of success; It is part of success” by Arianna Huffington. This phrase is what I want to remember in my entire life. I'm well aware that life is not easy, it is just how you see and face every situation. We all know that no one in this world, even the smallest thing, can live without failing. Not because you fail in a goal, you cannot make it anymore. Sometimes, it is how you do it and how you handle nor interact with it. Yes, you cannot avoid expectations, but you must be mentally prepared for everything. You must always have to look and see things positively to keep you stay motivated. 
	Making mistakes is not wrong. Why? Because you are gaining something from it, and you learn something from it. And I’m not afraid to make mistakes. You cannot also avoid it. If something came up and it does not go according to the plan, it's okay. At least, I know that I cannot make the same mistake again. Always remember that if Plan A did not work, there are still 25 more letters left in the alphabet.
	Success is what everybody wants. Everyone aims to be successful, but sometimes, they are being too hard to themselves that they cannot achieve their goals. It may sound unfit to some people but success depends a lot of hard work. We all have different mindset. And for me, it is how we see things differently. Others give up easily if they encounter failures, but as for me, I’m making it as my own advantage because it is how I excel and grow at everything. And I’m using it as a fuel to drive towards my future.
	To sum it all up, we can say that success is like a seed that needs a balance proportion of all elements in life. You have to face all the problems and learn how to solve it. Above all, success is the feeling of fulfillment that you feel when you achieve your goal.
